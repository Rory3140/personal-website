                    <p>
                        I have been coding in Java for over six years now making it the programming
                        language that I am most proficient in. Over the years I have completed numerous
                        projects using Java. These have ranged from simple and advanced algorithms to a
                        quiz application completed using Java Swing which boasted a comprehensive login
                        and registration as well as seamless integration with a back-end database.

                    <p>
                        I gained proficiency in PHP through self-study. After learning the fundamentals
                        of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my web development course, I took on numerous
                        projects that demanded dynamic website functionality, thus necessitating the
                        utilization of PHP for coding purposes.

                    <p>
                        I first gained exposure to JavaScript in my web development class at university
                        where I learned the fundamentals of the language and the basics of the React
                        framework. Since then, I have taught myself more advanced aspects of JavaScript
                        to complete various front-end and back-end projects.

                    <p>
                        I have been using React for over a year now and have completed numerous projects
                        using the framework. I have found React to be an incredibly powerful tool for
                        creating dynamic and responsive web applications and have enjoyed using it to
                        create a variety of projects.

                    <p>
                        I picked up Python myself at secondary school and continued it in university in a
                        robotics class.I enjoy using Python for web automation and creating customized
                        scripts to streamline processes.

                    <p>
                        Through self-teaching I have gained a strong understanding of C++ and its similarities
                        to C have allowed me to quickly adapt to coding at a high level. I have used C++ mainly
                        for developing applications and game development which has allowed me to utilize my
                        skills in creative and practical ways.

            <p>
                I am an enthusiastic, outgoing, and positive person with an eagerness to learn and
                embrace new challenges. I have had a passion for computers and technology for as long
                as I can remember - since learning Java eight years ago I have been captivated by the
                sense of creative freedom and the opportunity for critical thinking that Development
                and Coding provides. This has driven me to not only pursue a career in this field but
                also to teach myself various essential languages, expanding my understanding and
                knowledge.<br>

                <br>While coding is my true passion, I am far from a typical Computer Science student.
                I am also an avid rugby player, having represented my country with Ireland U19 and
                currently playing for both my university at Division 1 level and the New York Major
                League Rugby Academy. My experience in rugby has taught me invaluable lessons in teamwork,
                perseverance, and leadership, all of which I bring to the table when working with others
                on coding projects.
